    <h1>Student Report</h1>
    <h2>Subjects</h2>
    <h3>Maths</h3>
    <p>Mathematics involves the study of numbers, shapes, and patterns. This subject helps students develop analytical and problem-solving skills.</p>
    <h3>Science</h3>
    <p>Science encourages curiosity and understanding of the natural world, covering topics like physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>
    <h2>Question 7</h2>
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the layout and elements of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. HTML provides the skeleton or structure of a webpage, using elements enclosed in angle brackets like h1,p, and a. Although HTML alone doesn't make a webpage visually appealing or interactive, it is the foundation upon which all websites are built</p>

    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS is used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements. It allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS separates design from structure, making it easier to maintain and update the visual aspects of a website. Styles can be applied inline, internally in the <head> section, or externally using a separate .css file. With modern CSS, developers can also create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.</p>

    <h2>Question 10</h2>
    <p><em>Quantum Computing is an emerging field of technology that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers. Unlike classical bits, which represent data as either 0 or 1, quantum bits—or qubits—can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to superposition. Additionally, qubits can be entangled, meaning the state of one qubit is directly related to the state of another, no matter the distance between them.</em></p>
